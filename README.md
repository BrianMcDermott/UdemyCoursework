# UdemyCoursework
Coursework in progress or completed on Udemy, I finished most of the basic exercises and challenges and didn't push them to git because I considered them a review of things that I already knew. I am now pushing each exercise and challenge I complete that involves practice and study of more relevant OOP principles.
